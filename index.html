					The Uchiha Clan (うちは一族, Uchiha Ichizoku) is one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure, reputed to be the village's strongest because of their Sharingan and natural battle prowess. After helping found Konoha decades ago, the Uchiha grew increasingly isolated from the village's affairs, culminating in most of their deaths during the Uchiha Clan Downfall. Few Uchiha now survive into the present day.

          <h1><span>Who is Uchiha?</span></h1>
          <p>
            Uchiha is a fictional clan in "Naruto" anime series.
            Members (Uchihas) of the Uchiha clan are considered to feel the deep empathy and to love more than other clans.
            However, Uchihas believed that they natural ability to love is a weakness. Thus, they partly hid any signs of affection, and that in turn made them look as the most evil clan.
            In fact, Uchihas experience love deep inside their hearts. Nevertheless, when an Uchiha experiences considerable emotional distress or loses intimate person (like parent, siblings, friends)
            Uchiha's strong sense of love will transform into a sense of hatred towards offenders and desire to revenge.
            <br>
            That is the nature of the Uchiha ...
          </p>
        </div>
				<div class="text-main__title">
					<h1><span>General Abilities<span></h1>
            <p>
              Uchihas are innately physically strong and have potent chakra (energy to use nature styles) since they are descendants of Otsutsuki clan.
              Uchihas are renowned for their "Sharingan" that empowers their skills; the "Sharingan" type is the most powerful visual kekkei genkai.
              However, Uchiha is not the strongest clan. Senju clan is the strongest one and they are the only ones who were able to confront Uchihas.
              Uchiha clan and Senju clan were always in rivalry.
            </p>
					<!-- <p>
						The Uchiha were known for having an innate aptitude for all combat-oriented skills and an advanced growth rate. They also have an especially potent chakra quality as well as a natural affinity for the fire nature transformation; Uchiha are not truly considered adults until they can successfully perform the Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique. Exceptional Uchiha have such skill with Fire Release that either multiple Water Release users working in tandem or a similarly skilled Water Release user are required to extinguish their flames. Uchiha also frequently use ninja tools in combat, being best known for their use of shuriken. <br>
					</p>
					<p> -->

						<!-- <span>The Uchiha clan are most feared for their dōjutsu kekkei genkai, the Sharingan. They can use their Sharingan to see chakra, cast various genjutsu, and, most infamously, copy opponents' jutsu. The Sharingan is such a versatile ability that many ninja consider it wiser to flee than to face an Uchiha in one-on-one combat. Sharingan can be evolved into Mangekyō Sharingan by experiencing loss of a loved one, granting the user new and more powerful jutsu. Overuse of the Mangekyō eventually robs the Mangekyō of its sight, something that can only be restored by receiving another's eyes, preferably a sibling's, to create "eternal" Mangekyō. The Mangekyō's mechanics were long poorly misunderstood by the Uchiha, causing many to personally kill their loved ones to gain power.</span>
